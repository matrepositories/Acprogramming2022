/*
In this exercise you will split string based on another string.
For example "String to be split", which is split by " ", will
result in an array containing the split parts: ["String","to","be","split",NULL].
The resulting arrays will always end with a NULL pointer.

The exercise has two parts:

a) Implement a function void print_split_string(char** split_string), which
prints a split string, each part on its own line. For example when calling
the function for a split string ["String","to","be","split",NULL], 
the function prints:

    String
    to
    be
    split

b) Implement functions 
    - char** split_string(const char* str, const char* split)
    
        The function splits a string in the
        aforementioned way and returns the parts in a dynamically reserved array.
        Parameters are as follows:

        - const char* str, the string to be split
        - const char* split, the string used to split str,
        for example "One. .more. .test. .for. .string. .splitting." and ". .", when
        the result is an array consisting of the following pieces:
        ["One","more","test","for","string","splitting.",NULL]
        
        Also, the pieces need to have their memory dynamically reserved and they need
        to be copied to the array. The function strstr may be helpful in this exercise.
        
    - free_split_string(char** split_string)
        
        The function frees the memory for the split string array.
